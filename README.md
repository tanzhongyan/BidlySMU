## **2. Key Differences Between Versions**
- **V4 (Recommended)**: Revolutionary three-model architecture with **classification + median + min bid prediction models**, advanced uncertainty quantification using t-distribution fitting, entropy-based confidence scoring, and sophisticated percentile-based safety factors.
- **V3 (Deprecated)**: Introduced bug fixes, two **pre-trained `.cbm` models** for **minimum and median bid predictions** without re-training.
- **V2 (Deprecated)**: Enhances V1 by incorporating scraped data from the BOSS website, including class timings, for improved predictions.
- **V1 (Deprecated)**: Utilizes readily available data from the OASIS BOSS bidding results.

## **3. Project Overview**

### **V4 (Recommended)**
- **Purpose**: Provides a comprehensive three-model system with advanced uncertainty quantification for production-ready bid predictions.
- **Key Features**:
  1. **Three-model architecture**: Classification (bid opportunity detection) + Median + Min regression models
  2. **Advanced uncertainty quantification**: T-distribution-based confidence intervals and entropy-based confidence scoring
  3. **Sophisticated safety factor system**: Percentile-based multipliers (1%-99%) derived from validation error analysis
  4. **Enhanced feature engineering**: Day-of-week boolean flags and optimized categorical encoding
  5. **Production-ready deployment**: All models saved as `.cbm` files with consistent interfaces
  6. **Risk-aware predictions**: Distribution-based uncertainty modeling prevents dangerous under-bidding
  7. **Scientific rigor**: Replaces ad-hoc safety factors with statistically grounded uncertainty measures

### **V3** (Deprecated)
- **Purpose**: Provides a pre-trained `.cbm` model for instant predictions without requiring dataset reprocessing.
- **Key Features**:
  1. Directly **loads pre-trained models** from the repository.
  2. No need for additional feature engineering.
  3. Works out-of-the-box with structured course data.

### **V2** (Deprecated)
- **Purpose**: Improve prediction accuracy using additional features like class timings.
- **Key Features**:
  1. Scraped data enhanced the dataset significantly.
  2. Feature selection was performed to manage diminishing returns.

### **V1** (Deprecated)
- **Purpose**: Evaluate and compare different machine learning models (CatBoost and DNN) using OASIS data.
- **Key Features**:
  1. CatBoost models explored default, tuned, and cleaned versions.
  2. Neural networks were tested but found less suitable for this tabular data.

## **4. Key Findings**

### **V4 Breakthrough Improvements**
1. **Multi-model approach**: Separate classification and regression models significantly improve prediction accuracy and reliability
2. **Scientific uncertainty quantification**: T-distribution fitting to validation errors provides statistically grounded confidence intervals
3. **Recall-optimized classification**: Maximizes detection of courses that will receive bids, minimizing missed opportunities
4. **Distribution-aware safety factors**: Percentile-based multipliers (e.g., 90% confidence) replace arbitrary percentage increases
5. **Enhanced feature engineering**: Day-of-week patterns and improved instructor handling boost model performance
6. **Production deployment ready**: Comprehensive model persistence and consistent interfaces for real-world usage

### **V3 Improvements** (Deprecated)
1. No re-training required‚Äîmodels are pre-trained and available as `.cbm` files.
2. Fixed bugs such as dependency on future values and outlier removal.

### **V2 Enhancements** (Deprecated)
1. Adding class timings significantly reduces prediction errors.
2. Additional features lead to diminishing returns beyond a certain point.
3. Adding safety factors or bootstrapping confidence intervals could improve predictions but requires more computation.

### **V1 Summary** (Deprecated)
1. CatBoost models perform better for tabular data with categorical variables.
2. Default CatBoost is nearly as effective as tuned models.
3. Removing outliers (e.g., troll bids) has limited impact on performance.
4. Latest academic year data provides the most predictive power.
5. Combining data from all years yields the best results.

## **5. V4 Model Architecture**

### **Three-Model System**
| **Model Type** | **Purpose** | **Output** | **Uncertainty Measure** |
|----------------|-------------|------------|--------------------------|
| **Classification** | Predict bid courses | Probability + Confidence Level | Entropy-based confidence score |
| **Median Bid Regression** | Predict median bid price | Price + Uncertainty Multipliers | T-distribution-based multipliers |
| **Min Bid Regression** | Predict minimum bid price | Price + Uncertainty Multipliers | T-distribution-based multipliers |

### **Advanced Safety Factor Formula**
**Traditional approach**: `bid = prediction √ó 1.7` (arbitrary multiplier)  
**V4 approach**: `bid = prediction + uncertainty √ó multiplier` (distribution-based)

**Example (90% confidence)**:
- Median bid = `median_predicted + median_uncertainty √ó 1.584`
- Min bid = `min_predicted + min_uncertainty √ó 1.533`
