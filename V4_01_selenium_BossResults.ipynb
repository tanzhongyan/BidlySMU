    "### **Objective**\n",
    "This script is designed to scrape SMU course details from the BOSS system using Selenium. The process involves:\n",
    "1. Logging into the system manually to bypass authentication.\n",
    "2. Iteratively scraping class details for specified academic years and terms.\n",
    "3. Writing the scraped data to structured CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is then ingested into [AfterClass.io](https://www.afterclass.io/) to serve students.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Script Structure**\n",
    "1. **Setup**: Import libraries and initialize Selenium WebDriver.\n",
    "2. **Login**: Wait for manual login and authentication.\n",
    "3. **Scraping Logic**:\n",
    "    - `scrape_class_details`: Scrapes course details for a specific class number, academic year, and term.\n",
    "    - `main`: Manages the scraping process for multiple academic years and terms.\n",
    "4. **Execution**: Log in and start scraping."

    "### **BOSS Class Scraper Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What This Code Does**\n",
    "The `BOSSClassScraper` class automates the extraction of class timing data from SMU's BOSS system. It systematically scrapes class details across multiple academic terms and saves them as HTML files for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Automated Web Scraping**: Navigates through BOSS class detail pages using Selenium WebDriver\n",
    "- **Resume Capability**: Automatically detects existing scraped files and continues from the last scraped class number, preventing duplicate work\n",
    "- **Flexible Term Range**: Dynamically derives academic years from input parameters (e.g., '2025-26_T1' to '2028-29_T2') rather than hardcoded lists\n",
    "- **Smart Pagination**: Scans class numbers from 1000-5000 with intelligent termination after 300 consecutive empty records\n",
    "- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors existing files and resumes scraping from the highest class number found for each term\n",
    "- **Data Organization**: Saves HTML files in structured directories by academic term (`script_input/classTimingsFull/`)\n",
    "- **Incremental CSV Updates**: Appends only new valid files to the existing CSV index, avoiding duplicates\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What Is Required**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Dependencies:**\n",
    "- Python packages: `selenium`, `webdriver-manager`, standard libraries (`os`, `time`, `csv`, `re`)\n",
    "- Chrome browser and ChromeDriver (auto-managed)\n",
    "- Network access to SMU's BOSS system\n",
    "\n",
    "**User Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Manual Authentication**: User must manually log in and complete Microsoft Authenticator process when prompted\n",
    "- **SMU Credentials**: Valid access to BOSS system\n",
    "- **Directory Structure**: Code creates `script_input/classTimingsFull/` for HTML files and `script_input/scraped_filepaths.csv` for the file index\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resume Functionality:**\n",
    "- **Interruption Handling**: If scraping stops halfway due to network issues or manual interruption, the next run automatically resumes from the exact point it left off\n",
    "- **Duplicate Prevention**: Existing files are automatically detected and skipped, preventing re-downloading of already scraped data\n",
    "- **Natural Termination**: Uses 300 consecutive empty records threshold to handle BOSS system inconsistencies without hardcoded limits\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage in Jupyter Notebook:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "scraper = BOSSClassScraper()\n",
    "# Will automatically resume from previous progress if files exist\n",
    "success = scraper.run_full_scraping_process('2025-26_T1', '2025-26_T3B')\n",
    "```"

    "## **3. Extract Data from HTML Files**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **HTML Data Extractor Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What This Code Does**\n",
    "The `HTMLDataExtractor` class processes previously scraped HTML files from SMU's BOSS system and extracts structured data into Excel format. It systematically parses course information, class timings, academic terms, and exam schedules from local HTML files without requiring network access or authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Local File Processing**: Uses Selenium WebDriver to parse local HTML files without network connectivity requirements\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Data Extraction**: Extracts course details, academic terms, class timings, exam schedules, grading information, and professor names\n",
    "- **Test-First Approach**: Includes `run_test()` function to validate extraction logic on a small sample before processing all files\n",
    "- **Structured Output**: Organizes extracted data into two Excel sheets - standalone records (one per HTML file) and multiple records (class/exam timings)\n",
    "- **Error Tracking**: Captures and logs parsing errors in a separate sheet for debugging and quality assurance\n",
    "- **Flexible Data Parsing**: Handles multiple academic term naming conventions and date formats used across different years\n",
    "- **Record Linking**: Uses record keys to maintain relationships between standalone and multiple data records\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What Is Required**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Dependencies:**\n",
    "- Python packages: `selenium`, `webdriver-manager`, `pandas`, `openpyxl`, standard libraries (`os`, `re`, `datetime`, `pathlib`)\n",
    "- Chrome browser and ChromeDriver (auto-managed)\n",
    "- No network access required (processes local files only)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Scraped HTML Files**: Previously downloaded HTML files from BOSS system stored locally\n",
    "- **File Path CSV**: `script_input/scraped_filepaths.csv` containing paths to valid HTML files\n",
    "- **Directory Structure**: HTML files organized in the expected folder structure (typically `script_input/classTimingsFull/`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Structure:**\n",
    "- **Excel File**: `script_input/raw_data.xlsx` (or custom path) with multiple sheets:\n",
    "  - `standalone`: One record per HTML file with course and class information\n",
    "  - `multiple`: Multiple records for class timings and exam schedules\n",
    "  - `errors`: Parsing errors and problematic files for debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Extraction Capabilities:**\n",
    "- **Course Information**: Course codes, names, descriptions, credit units, course areas, enrollment requirements\n",
    "- **Academic Terms**: Term IDs, academic years, start/end dates, BOSS IDs\n",
    "- **Class Details**: Sections, grading basis, course outline URLs, professor names\n",
    "- **Timing Data**: Class schedules, exam dates, venues, day-of-week information\n",
    "- **Cross-References**: Maintains linking keys between related records across sheets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage in Jupyter Notebook:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Initialize extractor\n",
    "extractor = HTMLDataExtractor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test with sample files first (recommended)\n",
    "test_success = extractor.run_test(test_count=10)\n",

    "### **What This Code Does**\n",
    "The `TableBuilder` class processes structured data from the HTML extractor and transforms it into database-ready CSV files for SMU's class management system. It handles complex data relationships, professor name normalization, duplicate detection, and creates all necessary tables for courses, classes, professors, timing schedules, bidding data, and faculty assignments while maintaining referential integrity across all database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Three-Phase Processing**: Phase 1 (professors/courses with automated faculty mapping), Phase 2 (classes/timings), Phase 3 (BOSS bidding results)\n",
    "- **Intelligent Professor Matching**: Advanced name normalization with email resolution via Outlook integration and comprehensive duplicate detection\n",
    "- **Automated Faculty Mapping**: Uses BOSS data to automatically assign courses to SMU's schools and centers based on department codes\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Data Pipeline**: Processes professors, courses, academic terms, classes, class timings, exam schedules, bid windows, class availability, and bid results\n",
    "- **Database Cache Integration**: Loads existing data from PostgreSQL to avoid duplicates and maintain consistency\n",
    "- **Manual Review Workflow**: Outputs verification files for human review and correction before final processing\n",
    "- **Asian Name Handling**: Specialized normalization for Asian, Western, and mixed naming conventions with hardcoded multi-instructor handling\n",
    "- **BOSS Integration**: Complete processing of SMU's bidding system results with hierarchical window ordering and failed mapping tracking\n",
    "- **Data Integrity Validation**: Comprehensive validation system that checks referential integrity across all generated CSV files\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Raw Data Excel**: `script_input/raw_data.xlsx` from HTML extractor with `standalone` and `multiple` sheets\n",
    "- **BOSS Results**: Excel files in `script_input/overallBossResults/` directory for bidding data processing\n",
    "- **Database Configuration**: `.env` file with PostgreSQL connection parameters\n",
    "- **Professor Lookup**: `script_input/professor_lookup.csv` for existing professor mappings (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Structure:**\n",
    "- **Verification Files** (`script_output/verify/`): `new_professors.csv`, `new_courses.csv`, `new_faculties.csv`\n",
    "- **Database Insert Files** (`script_output/`): All table CSV files including classes, timings, exams, bid data, and academic terms\n",
    "- **Validation Reports**: Data integrity validation with error/warning reports and statistics\n",
    "- **Processing Logs**: Detailed BOSS processing logs with timestamps and failure analysis"

One reason for firms to innovate is the necessity to re-invent themselves and get out of stagnation: the industry has either gotten obsolete, or competitors have adopted newer and more efficient business models, and products or services based on more advanced technologies. Innovation is then a necessity as the firm has to innovate or perish, one only has to look at what happened to Blockbuster and Kodak. Blockbuster at one point of time was the leading media rental firm in the world, but they chose to ignore innovation in the way they were delivering their media content to customers. As Netflix gained scale, Blockbuster’s inability to innovate meant that their business model was obsolete, and they had no choice but to file for bankruptcy. Kodak is another famous example: Steven Sasson at Kodak invented the digital camera way back in the 1970s, but rather than developing and commercializing the innovation, Kodak chose to put the new technology on the backburner, as its commercialization would have meant that their existing business model that relied on chemical printing of photographs would have to be cannibalized. However, other competitors jumped on the bandwagon for competitive advantage: hence, if you do not pursue innovation, your competitors will make you obsolete someday, no product or business model has an eternal shelf life. Innovation has many dimensions: it creates value for existing customers, thereby letting you keep your current market share; it creates value for new customers, enabling you to get growth; it enables you to work with new processes to access a lower cost base; supplier innovation enables you to leverage partners’ innovation capabilities to offer value to customers, and capture value for yourself. So the notion of continuous improvement is indeed extendable to continuous innovation, the business world in all sectors moves on a treadmill; the pace of the treadmill is faster in some industries like technology and fashion, and slower in some other industries. Innovation is the lever that enables you to keep pace on the treadmill if you are at the industry average; and enables you to set the pace if you innovate at a faster rate than the industry average.

This course is different from Computational Thinking, as it goes into the theoretical underpinnings of efficiency, covers more data structures, and delves deeply into the implementations of those data structures.'\n",

Reports have revealed that only a small percentage of HC practitioners are proficient in undertaking advanced univariate analyses and that an even fewer number can perform advanced multivariate analyses.

Appropriate research methods allow us to rigorously investigate and develop evidence to address important problems. This section of the course is an introductory master-level seminar on empirical research methods in the context of business research.

      "HC analytics focuses on the use of people data for HC decisions and it involves mapping HC initiatives to business outcomes. The key benefits of employing HC analytics include quantifying returns on HC investments and optimizing employee investments to achieve tangible business outcomes. However, the challenge faced by HC practitioners lies in knowing what to analyze and how to analyze. Reports have revealed that only a small percentage of HC practitioners are proficient in undertaking advanced univariate analyses and that an even fewer number can perform advanced multivariate analyses.

This topic includes two parts, the network effects on innovation between different types of firms and the R&D of industrial generic technologies, in which we will discuss the various cooperation mechanisms employed. 5. The empirical evaluation on technology innovation policies. Based on Chinese policy cases and firm-level data, we will discuss some empirical research on technology innovation policies, trying to reveal the prerequisites and mechanisms by which the policies work. 6. The innovation strategy and Chinese long-term economic growth. In this section, the main task is building the relationship between the current innovation strategy and the long-term economic potential in China under the growth accounting framework.'\n",

Be able to state the challenges and potential artificial intelligence solutions that could be applied, and the relevant legal and ethical considerations associated. Students will be able to implement the chosen solution from inception to production. This will give students a significant edge in their financial services career.' to 'The financial services industry world-wide is facing more challenges than ever. An increased competitive environment with new challenger businesses re-writing whole sectors of the industry, together with being under increased regulatory scrutiny from both central banks and international bodies. To assist them, the financial services industry is collecting ever increasing amounts of data from their internal processes, customers and services, and applying state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms to find value and service automation. The knowledge and understanding that are needed for an artificial intelligence and data analytics professional in financial services includes, but is not limited to, data management, analysis, mathematics and statistics, machine learning and deep learning as well as an intimate knowledge of the specific financial services domain including the regulations and compliance surrounding it. This module aims to bring these skills and knowledge together to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence techniques and their applications in financial services. Using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms coupled with class discussion, labs and guest speakers from the industry, the students can understand how domain knowledge (such as compliance and regulation) interacts with artificial intelligence solutions and value chains through a range of industry cases. This module is also designed to take advantage of the diversity in students’ background to give varied points-of-view during each lab project and discussion. This closely emulates many financial services artificial intelligence environments. To ensure students have the required level of knowledge and skills, pre-requisites are set. After completion of the module, students will be able to identify potential areas within the current financial services landscape shaped by local and regional regulators. Be able to state the challenges and potential artificial intelligence solutions that could be applied, and the relevant legal and ethical considerations associated. Students will be able to implement the chosen solution from inception to production. This will give students a significant edge in their financial services career.'\n",

      "This workshop will equip students with the skills to write an effective Cover Letter and resume that will help them secure an internship – this is just the basic workshop as most 2nd years will not have sufficient internship or work experience to help them enhance their employability. Students will be exposed to different formats and the effective uses under various circumstances. They will be taught how to create a CV and the sections which are normally included in a CV and the contents to be featured under each section. Advanced CV writing will be taught as an elective in the 3rd or 4th year for those who want help and guidance to strengthen their CVs and start their job applications.\n",

      "SMU has built a credible brand among the employers however, its brand attributes must also be reflected in its students. There are certain attributes that have attracted employers to SMU students, such as being articulate, innovative, intellectual curiosity, courage to challenge the status quo, adventuresome, skilful and resourceful. The emphasis should be for students to build a believable and consistent long-lasting personal brand with focus on core values for the workplace and in society, not just being well-groomed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Networking skills are critical for students to succeed. To be effective networkers, they need to understand the acceptable decorum and etiquette for establishing business relationships and friendships; and the “how-tos” of maintaining contacts and building long-term relationships at work and play.\n",

      "Interviews can be at times daunting and can be very stressful especially if the candidate walks into an interview without adequate preparation. Students can use the interview session to their advantage to impress the interviewers and present themselves as good potential hires. The interview session is not only to secure an internship or job but also a two way communication to explore and discover whether there is a good fit between the candidate, the job and the organizational and candidate’s expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The objective of this workshop is to help students understand the objectives of the interviews, the different types of interviews and equip and practice good interviewing and listening skills in preparation for the internship/job applications.'\n",

      "In particular, we will debate implications on Singapore’s transition into a knowledge-, innovation- and service based economy as an example to contrast initiatives in other Asian Megacities, such as Shanghai, Jakarta or Mumbai. Special topics on “Asian Cultures“, “Finite System Thinking”, “Non-linear Behaviour”, “Risk Mitigation” and “Venture Capital in Asia” complement the course. Trends are internalized through examples and an Asia-related, desktop-based research project to ascertain a solid understanding of ongoing debates. An appreciation of the emergence of Asia, a general interest in current world affairs and a passion to create a better future are pre-requisites to succeed in this course.'\n",

More importantly, this course allows students to apply cross-disciplinary and project management approaches while learning and applying machine learning techniques to help Thai companies to effectively and efficiently apply data analytics and machine learning to improve their competitiveness and business efficiency. It hones students’ problem-solving skills and prepares them for the complex regional business environment today. Thailand, as part of ASEAN, is rich in natural resources eg. gems and precious metals and is considered to be one of the vital exporters of resources globally. Other than the 2 traditional sectors of agriculture and tourism, it is also a prime manufacturing hub for investors in vehicles, electronics and medical equipment. In recent years, Covid-19 has become a key accelerator for digital transformation globally and the Thai government has also been relentlessly encouraging its businesses to adopt digital technologies and the use of data analytics. This course is not biddable. Students will be shortlisted for interviews and selected students will be enrolled via offline enrolment (e$20 will be deducted).'\n",

One reason for firms to innovate is the necessity to re-invent themselves and get out of stagnation: the industry has either gotten obsolete, or competitors have adopted newer and more efficient business models, and products or services based on more advanced technologies. Innovation is then a necessity as the firm has to innovate or perish, one only has to look at what happened to Blockbuster and Kodak. Blockbuster at one point of time was the leading media rental firm in the world, but they chose to ignore innovation in the way they were delivering their media content to customers. As Netflix gained scale, Blockbuster’s inability to innovate meant that their business model was obsolete, and they had no choice but to file for bankruptcy. Kodak is another famous example: Steven Sasson at Kodak invented the digital camera way back in the 1970s, but rather than developing and commercializing the innovation, Kodak chose to put the new technology on the backburner, as its commercialization would have meant that their existing business model that relied on chemical printing of photographs would have to be cannibalized. However, other competitors jumped on the bandwagon for competitive advantage: hence, if you do not pursue innovation, your competitors will make you obsolete someday, no product or business model has an eternal shelf life. Innovation has many dimensions: it creates value for existing customers, thereby letting you keep your current market share; it creates value for new customers, enabling you to get growth; it enables you to work with new processes to access a lower cost base; supplier innovation enables you to leverage partners’ innovation capabilities to offer value to customers, and capture value for yourself. So the notion of continuous improvement is indeed extendable to continuous innovation, the business world in all sectors moves on a treadmill; the pace of the treadmill is faster in some industries like technology and fashion, and slower in some other industries. Innovation is the lever that enables you to keep pace on the treadmill if you are at the industry average; and enables you to set the pace if you innovate at a faster rate than the industry average. If you stand still on the treadmill or run at a slower pace than the treadmill in a competitive environment, at some stage, you will be thrown off the treadmill.\n",

      "Managing innovation and growth is challenging, as innovation can be driven by multiple facets. Business innovation can be classified into three kinds: (i) innovation of the core products and services that are offered to customers, called product or service innovation. This is the most commonly understood kind of innovation, the firm can either create improved variants of existing products and services, giving them a competitive advantage in the current industry scenario; or it can create radically new products and services that create new markets. The Apple iMac comes out with new variants all the time that are faster and lighter, this would be an example of an innovation that gives you a competitive advantage in an existing market. The iPad created a new market, in that it was somewhere between a mobile phone and a laptop, the phablet would be an example of a product that created a new market. (ii) innovations in the design of the supply chain enable the firm to lower its cost base, leverage the innovative capabilities of its suppliers, and get its products and services to your customers faster and at lower cost. Toyota’s well-known Keiretsu model is a good example of process or supply chain innovation, that lowers the cost of delivery, and improves service levels simultaneously. Finally, (iii) innovations at the interface of the firm with their suppliers and consumers enables customers to provide more value to their customers, and capture more value for themselves, by matching supply and demand better. Zara’s famed agile model, where they design and produce small batches to understand customer preferences and then scale production of bestsellers has enabled them to get a significant market and cost advantage, Zara is the world’s biggest apparel seller today. This course has a large emphasis on hands-on learning, using simulations and classroom exercises to give the participant a better idea of advancements in innovations and growth. The course gives the participant an overview of the issues of innovation and growth management in a wide variety of industries, including digital businesses.  After completing the course, the student should be able to characterize the innovation and growth issues in an industry/firm, evaluate current practice and identify improvement opportunities for making innovation sustainable using resources on a global scale.' to 'Necessity is the mother of invention. One reason for firms to innovate is the necessity to re-invent themselves and get out of stagnation: the industry has either gotten obsolete, or competitors have adopted newer and more efficient business models, and products or services based on more advanced technologies. Innovation is then a necessity as the firm has to innovate or perish, one only has to look at what happened to Blockbuster and Kodak. Blockbuster at one point of time was the leading media rental firm in the world, but they chose to ignore innovation in the way they were delivering their media content to customers. As Netflix gained scale, Blockbuster’s inability to innovate meant that their business model was obsolete, and they had no choice but to file for bankruptcy. Kodak is another famous example: Steven Sasson at Kodak invented the digital camera way back in the 1970s, but rather than developing and commercializing the innovation, Kodak chose to put the new technology on the backburner, as its commercialization would have meant that their existing business model that relied on chemical printing of photographs would have to be cannibalized. However, other competitors jumped on the bandwagon for competitive advantage: hence, if you do not pursue innovation, your competitors will make you obsolete someday, no product or business model has an eternal shelf life. Innovation has many dimensions: it creates value for existing customers, thereby letting you keep your current market share; it creates value for new customers, enabling you to get growth; it enables you to work with new processes to access a lower cost base; supplier innovation enables you to leverage partners’ innovation capabilities to offer value to customers, and capture value for yourself. So the notion of continuous improvement is indeed extendable to continuous innovation, the business world in all sectors moves on a treadmill; the pace of the treadmill is faster in some industries like technology and fashion, and slower in some other industries. Innovation is the lever that enables you to keep pace on the treadmill if you are at the industry average; and enables you to set the pace if you innovate at a faster rate than the industry average. If you stand still on the treadmill or run at a slower pace than the treadmill in a competitive environment, at some stage, you will be thrown off the treadmill. This course should be of particular interest to people aspiring for a career in designing and managing for innovation, either directly (e.g., V.P. of R&D, R&D Manager) or indirectly (e.g., management consulting). The course will also be useful to SME proprietors and entrepreneurs who intend to serve new markets, or use new technologies, or participants who wish to strategically reposition their offerings in an existing market. The course should also be of interest to people who manage interfaces between innovation and business functions such as finance, marketing, managerial accounting and human resources. This course introduces the student to ‘the front end of innovation’. We will explore the practice of innovation, and we will also apply the techniques and principles of innovation that will step through the ideation and opportunity recognition ‘front end’ of innovation.

ESG risk management is increasingly vital for companies due to several compelling reasons: 1. Reputation and Brand Value: Companies with strong ESG practices are perceived more positively by consumers, investors, and other stakeholders. Managing ESG risks helps protect and enhance a company's reputation and brand value, reducing the risk of negative publicity and boycotts. 2. Regulatory Compliance: Governments and regulatory bodies are imposing stricter ESG-related regulations. Effective ESG risk management ensures compliance with these regulations, avoiding fines, legal action, and operational disruptions. 3. Investor Demand: Investors are increasingly considering ESG factors in their investment decisions. Companies that manage ESG risks well attract more investment and often benefit from lower capital costs. ESG performance is now a key metric for many institutional investors and funds. 4. Operational Efficiency and Cost Savings: Managing environmental risks can lead to more efficient resource use, waste reduction, and energy savings. Social and governance improvements can enhance employee satisfaction and productivity, reducing turnover and associated costs. 5. Risk Mitigation: ESG risks, such as climate change impacts, social unrest, and governance failures, can have significant financial and operational impacts. Proactively managing these risks helps companies avoid or mitigate potential losses and disruptions. 6. Competitive Advantage: Companies that excel in ESG risk management often have a competitive edge. They are better positioned to anticipate and adapt to market changes, meet stakeholder expectations, and capitalize on new business opportunities related to sustainability and ethical practices. 7. Long-Term Sustainability: ESG risk management supports the long-term sustainability of a company by addressing the broader impacts of its operations on the environment, society, and its governance structure. This holistic approach ensures the company can thrive in the future while contributing positively to the world.

Despite growing recognition of this imperative and increasing corporate commitments to decarbonisation, most of these commitments lack detailed and credible plans. Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 will require a fundamental transformation of the global economy, particularly in the energy and hard-to-abate sectors that contribute the most to global emissions. This transition demands significant investment, estimated at US$3-4 trillion per year, necessitating substantial scaling and deployment of both private and public sector capital. This course delves into decarbonisation pathways and key climate transition strategies within the energy and hard-to-abate sectors, equipping students with the knowledge and skills to assess credible transition planning and articulate key decarbonisation challenges and growth opportunities in the emergence of new clean technologies. The course also highlights the wider policy landscape and how significant government policies can influence the development of low-carbon products and their supply chains. Additionally, it explores various funding structures to finance companies' decarbonisation strategies, the meaning of sustainable business, and the need for companies to transition in a financially sustainable manner. By the end of this course, students will understand the challenges and opportunities associated with reducing carbon emissions in traditionally difficult-to-decarbonise sectors such as cement, steel, fossil fuel energy, and transport. They will gain foundational knowledge necessary for finance professionals to assess the viability and impact of decarbonisation and climate transition strategies. Students will learn about the technical processes and commercial viability of decarbonisation technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency improvements, and alternative fuels like hydrogen, as well as geographical considerations, national circumstances, and geopolitical factors. The course will also cover the role of international cooperation, government policies, and private sector initiatives in driving decarbonisation.

    "- Validates referential integrity across all generated CSV files by checking foreign key relationships between tables\n",
    "- Loads valid IDs from multiple sources: database cache files, new CSV files, professor lookup tables, and verification files\n",
    "- Performs comprehensive validation of course_id references in classes, professor_id fields (both single UUIDs and JSON arrays), and class_id references in timing tables\n",
    "- Checks UUID format validity and ensures all referenced IDs exist in their respective source tables\n",
    "- Generates detailed error reports with specific row numbers, invalid IDs, and raw professor names for debugging\n",
    "- Creates validation summary statistics including total records checked, error counts by type, and data loading metrics\n",
    "- Provides categorized error analysis for professor ID issues including format errors, missing references, and null assignments\n",
    "- Saves validation results to CSV files: `validation_errors.csv`, `validation_warnings.csv`, and `validation_summary.csv` for comprehensive quality assurance"
