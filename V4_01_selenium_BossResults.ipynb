    "### **Objective**\n",
    "This script is designed to scrape SMU course details from the BOSS system using Selenium. The process involves:\n",
    "1. Logging into the system manually to bypass authentication.\n",
    "2. Iteratively scraping class details for specified academic years and terms.\n",
    "3. Writing the scraped data to structured CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is then ingested into [AfterClass.io](https://www.afterclass.io/) to serve students.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Script Structure**\n",
    "1. **Setup**: Import libraries and initialize Selenium WebDriver.\n",
    "2. **Login**: Wait for manual login and authentication.\n",
    "3. **Scraping Logic**:\n",
    "    - `scrape_class_details`: Scrapes course details for a specific class number, academic year, and term.\n",
    "    - `main`: Manages the scraping process for multiple academic years and terms.\n",
    "4. **Execution**: Log in and start scraping."

    "### **BOSS Class Scraper Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What This Code Does**\n",
    "The `BOSSClassScraper` class automates the extraction of class timing data from SMU's BOSS system. It systematically scrapes class details across multiple academic terms and saves them as HTML files for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Automated Web Scraping**: Navigates through BOSS class detail pages using Selenium WebDriver\n",
    "- **Resume Capability**: Automatically detects existing scraped files and continues from the last scraped class number, preventing duplicate work\n",
    "- **Flexible Term Range**: Dynamically derives academic years from input parameters (e.g., '2025-26_T1' to '2028-29_T2') rather than hardcoded lists\n",
    "- **Smart Pagination**: Scans class numbers from 1000-5000 with intelligent termination after 300 consecutive empty records\n",
    "- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors existing files and resumes scraping from the highest class number found for each term\n",
    "- **Data Organization**: Saves HTML files in structured directories by academic term (`script_input/classTimingsFull/`)\n",
    "- **Incremental CSV Updates**: Appends only new valid files to the existing CSV index, avoiding duplicates\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What Is Required**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Dependencies:**\n",
    "- Python packages: `selenium`, `webdriver-manager`, standard libraries (`os`, `time`, `csv`, `re`)\n",
    "- Chrome browser and ChromeDriver (auto-managed)\n",
    "- Network access to SMU's BOSS system\n",
    "\n",
    "**User Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Manual Authentication**: User must manually log in and complete Microsoft Authenticator process when prompted\n",
    "- **SMU Credentials**: Valid access to BOSS system\n",
    "- **Directory Structure**: Code creates `script_input/classTimingsFull/` for HTML files and `script_input/scraped_filepaths.csv` for the file index\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resume Functionality:**\n",
    "- **Interruption Handling**: If scraping stops halfway due to network issues or manual interruption, the next run automatically resumes from the exact point it left off\n",
    "- **Duplicate Prevention**: Existing files are automatically detected and skipped, preventing re-downloading of already scraped data\n",
    "- **Natural Termination**: Uses 300 consecutive empty records threshold to handle BOSS system inconsistencies without hardcoded limits\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage in Jupyter Notebook:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "scraper = BOSSClassScraper()\n",
    "# Will automatically resume from previous progress if files exist\n",
    "success = scraper.run_full_scraping_process('2025-26_T1', '2025-26_T3B')\n",
    "```"

    "## **3. Extract Data from HTML Files**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **HTML Data Extractor Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What This Code Does**\n",
    "The `HTMLDataExtractor` class processes previously scraped HTML files from SMU's BOSS system and extracts structured data into Excel format. It systematically parses course information, class timings, academic terms, and exam schedules from local HTML files without requiring network access or authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Local File Processing**: Uses Selenium WebDriver to parse local HTML files without network connectivity requirements\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Data Extraction**: Extracts course details, academic terms, class timings, exam schedules, grading information, and professor names\n",
    "- **Test-First Approach**: Includes `run_test()` function to validate extraction logic on a small sample before processing all files\n",
    "- **Structured Output**: Organizes extracted data into two Excel sheets - standalone records (one per HTML file) and multiple records (class/exam timings)\n",
    "- **Error Tracking**: Captures and logs parsing errors in a separate sheet for debugging and quality assurance\n",
    "- **Flexible Data Parsing**: Handles multiple academic term naming conventions and date formats used across different years\n",
    "- **Record Linking**: Uses record keys to maintain relationships between standalone and multiple data records\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What Is Required**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Dependencies:**\n",
    "- Python packages: `selenium`, `webdriver-manager`, `pandas`, `openpyxl`, standard libraries (`os`, `re`, `datetime`, `pathlib`)\n",
    "- Chrome browser and ChromeDriver (auto-managed)\n",
    "- No network access required (processes local files only)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Scraped HTML Files**: Previously downloaded HTML files from BOSS system stored locally\n",
    "- **File Path CSV**: `script_input/scraped_filepaths.csv` containing paths to valid HTML files\n",
    "- **Directory Structure**: HTML files organized in the expected folder structure (typically `script_input/classTimingsFull/`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Structure:**\n",
    "- **Excel File**: `script_input/raw_data.xlsx` (or custom path) with multiple sheets:\n",
    "  - `standalone`: One record per HTML file with course and class information\n",
    "  - `multiple`: Multiple records for class timings and exam schedules\n",
    "  - `errors`: Parsing errors and problematic files for debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Extraction Capabilities:**\n",
    "- **Course Information**: Course codes, names, descriptions, credit units, course areas, enrollment requirements\n",
    "- **Academic Terms**: Term IDs, academic years, start/end dates, BOSS IDs\n",
    "- **Class Details**: Sections, grading basis, course outline URLs, professor names\n",
    "- **Timing Data**: Class schedules, exam dates, venues, day-of-week information\n",
    "- **Cross-References**: Maintains linking keys between related records across sheets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage in Jupyter Notebook:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Initialize extractor\n",
    "extractor = HTMLDataExtractor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test with sample files first (recommended)\n",
    "test_success = extractor.run_test(test_count=10)\n",
    "\n",
    "if test_success:\n",
    "    # Run full extraction\n",
    "    extractor.run()\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Or run directly without testing\n",
    "extractor.run(\n",
    "    scraped_filepaths_csv='script_input/scraped_filepaths.csv',\n",
    "    output_path='script_input/raw_data.xlsx'\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",

    "The `TableBuilder` class processes structured data from the HTML extractor and transforms it into database-ready CSV files for SMU's class management system. It handles complex data relationships, professor name normalization, duplicate detection, and creates all necessary tables for courses, classes, professors, timing schedules, bidding data, and faculty assignments while maintaining referential integrity across all database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Three-Phase Processing**: Phase 1 (professors/courses with automated faculty mapping), Phase 2 (classes/timings), Phase 3 (BOSS bidding results)\n",
    "- **Intelligent Professor Matching**: Advanced name normalization with email resolution via Outlook integration and comprehensive duplicate detection\n",
    "- **Automated Faculty Mapping**: Uses BOSS data to automatically assign courses to SMU's schools and centers based on department codes\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Data Pipeline**: Processes professors, courses, academic terms, classes, class timings, exam schedules, bid windows, class availability, and bid results\n",
    "- **Database Cache Integration**: Loads existing data from PostgreSQL to avoid duplicates and maintain consistency\n",
    "- **Manual Review Workflow**: Outputs verification files for human review and correction before final processing\n",
    "- **Asian Name Handling**: Specialized normalization for Asian, Western, and mixed naming conventions with hardcoded multi-instructor handling\n",
    "- **BOSS Integration**: Complete processing of SMU's bidding system results with hierarchical window ordering and failed mapping tracking\n",
    "- **Data Integrity Validation**: Comprehensive validation system that checks referential integrity across all generated CSV files\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Raw Data Excel**: `script_input/raw_data.xlsx` from HTML extractor with `standalone` and `multiple` sheets\n",
    "- **BOSS Results**: Excel files in `script_input/overallBossResults/` directory for bidding data processing\n",
    "- **Database Configuration**: `.env` file with PostgreSQL connection parameters\n",
    "- **Professor Lookup**: `script_input/professor_lookup.csv` for existing professor mappings (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Structure:**\n",
    "- **Verification Files** (`script_output/verify/`): `new_professors.csv`, `new_courses.csv`, `new_faculties.csv`\n",
    "- **Database Insert Files** (`script_output/`): All table CSV files including classes, timings, exams, bid data, and academic terms\n",
    "- **Validation Reports**: Data integrity validation with error/warning reports and statistics\n",
    "- **Processing Logs**: Detailed BOSS processing logs with timestamps and failure analysis"

    "- Handles hardcoded multi-instructor combinations and prevents duplicate professor creation through multiple validation strategies\n",
    "- Creates new courses from standalone data and automatically maps them to SMU faculties using BOSS department data\n",
    "- Generates academic terms with proper ID formatting and date range extraction\n",
    "- Outputs verification files for manual review: `new_professors.csv` for name corrections and `new_courses.csv` for faculty validation\n",

Innovation is then a necessity as the firm has to innovate or perish, one only has to look at what happened to Blockbuster and Kodak. Blockbuster at one point of time was the leading media rental firm in the world, but they chose to ignore innovation in the way they were delivering their media content to customers. As Netflix gained scale, Blockbuster’s inability to innovate meant that their business model was obsolete, and they had no choice but to file for bankruptcy. Kodak is another famous example: Steven Sasson at Kodak invented the digital camera way back in the 1970s, but rather than developing and commercializing the innovation, Kodak chose to put the new technology on the backburner, as its commercialization would have meant that their existing business model that relied on chemical printing of photographs would have to be cannibalized. However, other competitors jumped on the bandwagon for competitive advantage: hence, if you do not pursue innovation, your competitors will make you obsolete someday, no product or business model has an eternal shelf life. Innovation has many dimensions: it creates value for existing customers, thereby letting you keep your current market share; it creates value for new customers, enabling you to get growth; it enables you to work with new processes to access a lower cost base; supplier innovation enables you to leverage partners’ innovation capabilities to offer value to customers, and capture value for yourself. So the notion of continuous improvement is indeed extendable to continuous innovation, the business world in all sectors moves on a treadmill; the pace of the treadmill is faster in some industries like technology and fashion, and slower in some other industries. Innovation is the lever that enables you to keep pace on the treadmill if you are at the industry average; and enables you to set the pace if you innovate at a faster rate than the industry average.

This course is designed for students who wish to master Python as a programming language and wish to build data analysis solutions with Python and many widely used libraries. This course teaches both the Python programming language itself and how to carry out descriptive and diagnostic data analysis in Python. In the Python programming part, basic topics including data types, containers and control flow will be first introduced. As advanced topics in Python programming, lambda expressions, functions, modules and regular expressions will also be explained and elaborated in great details. In the second part, this course will teach functions in the three important libraries numpy, pandas and matplotlib. With these three libraries, students are then ready to perform descriptive and diagnostic data analysis with data visualization on sample datasets provided by the course instructors. Upon the completion of the course, students should be able to carry out data analysis with Python and related libraries at a high proficient level.'\n",

The field departs from assumptions of perfect competition and studies markets in which a small number of firms operate and can strategically influence their market’s outcome. We begin with the study of monopolies and platforms and then focus largely on the forms and consequences of oligopolistic competition, including product differentiation, advertising / branding, entry and exit, mergers and collusion, etc. Throughout these topics we will weave in the basic tools of empirical industrial organization as we use these theories to explain real-world firm behavior and market outcomes. Please note the first half of the class serves as a more in-depth treatment of several topics from Microeconomics 2 (ECON251), but this course is self-contained and does not require ECON251.' to 'This course introduces the main concepts of the modern theory of industrial organisation and competition, and its application to the competition policy and regulation. The course will equip students a set of tools to analyse firm competition in a variety of market structures, and will address issues such as R&D races, patent protection, advertising strategy, entry accommodation and deterrence, as well as discuss different forms of quantity and price competitions. Students will learn to analyse the different forces that drive market competition and the interactions among firms that lead to the different strategies that are adopted in different market environments.'\n",

Through the course, students will also learn how to create a successful strategy for sustainable operations by incorporating sustainability considerations into business strategy, improvement planning, product and process design, supply management, risk management and both internal and external reporting systems.' to 'The objective of this course is to study how companies use their operations to improve environmental (and social) performance and contribute to business success at the same time. Many companies have started doing so by integrating sustainability into their operations. A focus on reducing environmental impact not only allows these companies to comply with increased regulations but also to reduce their costs, to improve the quality of their products, and to enhance the reputation of their brands. In addition, a new brand of companies is going beyond simply reducing negative externalities and actively tries to create a positive impact on the world. In this course, students will learn how citizens, governments, customers, and employees are creating pressures for more sustainable development and how operations managers are responding to these pressures with principles and frameworks such as waste reduction, pollution prevention, and product stewardship. Through the course, students will study specific tools and concepts such as life cycle assessment (LCA), design for environment (DfE), take-back legislation, green manufacturing, green purchasing, remanufacturing, recycling and by-product synergy. Students will also learn how to create a successful strategy for sustainable operations by incorporating sustainability considerations into business strategy, improvement planning, product and process design, supply management and risk management.'\n",

It aims to equip students with the skills necessary for understanding and implementing data-driven decision-making in business contexts. The curriculum provides a step-by-step tutorial on constructing and applying machine learning algorithms for business problem-solving using Python programming. Central to the learning process, students will learn how to report and draw insights from analytics using advanced visualization frameworks and Python toolkits. Throughout the course, students will develop a comprehensive understanding of machine learning techniques. The real-world applications of the course cover a variety of business queries including market segmentation, personalization, algorithmic trading, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling of text data. The course strives to make machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) accessible, actionable, and interpretable (AAI), transforming these concepts into powerful tools for business problem-solving through effective visualization and data storytelling with Python. The course employs an interactive lecture format to explore the principles and applications of machine learning, paired with a hands-on programming approach. Students engage directly with the material by completing parts of provided script templates. This blend of conceptual and technical learning is crucial for the experiential aspect of the course, which is strongly emphasized to encourage students to learn by doing. Such an approach is essential for understanding and applying course material in real-world scenarios, enabling students to effectively collaborate with data science teams within their organizations. This course is specifically tailored for DDC-track students who aim to build analytical rigor with a strong emphasis on using the Python programming language for machine learning applications.

Comparative study of similar concepts and processes in other jurisdictions will also be assessed in the course of the study of the Singapore PDPA. The fundamental concepts and workings of the PDPA will be examined in depth. In the fourth part of the course, practitioners from the PDPC and the private sector will provide their perspectives on this process and a holistic and practical viewpoint to the study.\n",

This will prepare students for a career in this growing field, or at least provide them with the skills and knowledge when dealing with such issues as a TMT lawyer, legal counsel or even as a general legal practitioner that will possibly encounter these issues at work.'\n",

Sponsors will each supply 3-5 projects ideas to select from. Students will form teams of 5 or 6, and select one of the sponsors’ project ideas to work on. Project selections do not need to be unique, meaning multiple teams can select the same project idea. Each student project team will be assigned to a sponsor and an SMU faculty supervisor. Sponsors will provide project scope and management for student teams to have practical industry learning experiences. Student teams will have weekly check in meetings, either virtually or physically, with their sponsor. Student project teams will be expected to develop a working software application prototype, to be delivered to the sponsor at the end of the course.

Partners@WongPartnership will guide the students through each stage of the entrepreneur’s journey and discuss the legal issues the entrepreneur will encounter at the different stages of building the business.   The journey begins when the entrepreneur first look at the options that are available to start a business in Singapore.  While most entrepreneurs will opt for a private limited company as the start-up vehicle, there may well be other options that better suit the business needs.  Most start-ups will then explore ways of raising funds to support the business growth, looking first to venture capital providers and then bank borrowings, before eventually raising monies on the capital markets through an IPO with a listing on the Singapore Exchange.  Life as a listed company on the SGX will be more exciting, as the entrepreneur learns to cope with stricter corporate governance standards.  Pursuing M&A opportunities as a listed company is no longer a decision that entrepreneur can make on his own accord.  A successful listed company will in turn become the target of interest by other companies or private equity buy-out funds, looking to acquire and/or take the listed company private.  Unfortunately, leveraged buy outs don’t always end on a happy note; we will explore at the end of the course the scenario where the company struggles with debt servicing and going through the ensuing debt restructuring to save the business.

The latter requires interpersonal trust, care and concern as well as shared mind-sets regarding (transformative) goals and values such as the ‘real’ sharing propelled by collaborative leadership approaches.'\n",

Entities whose support of the proposed foreign investment venture, such as banks, suppliers, and customers, would also need to be assured that the political risk has been reduced by situating the proposed venture in the framework of applicable foreign investment law.'\n",

Key questions as we discuss theories of international trade are: Why do countries trade? What determines the pattern of international trade? What are the effects of international trade on income distribution? With these questions in mind, the course takes you through the classical models of trade that focus on cross-country differences as the source of gains from trade, the new trade theories that rely on imperfect competition and increasing returns to scale as the rationale for trade, and the recent models of multinational production with global sourcing of inputs.

NOTE: This is an algorithm and technical course, and it is highly recommended that students are proficient in programming, probabilities, statistics, linear algebra and calculus. Solid math background will be very useful and helpful for your learning journey. It is highly recommended that students have taken IS424 Data Mining and Business Analytics first if you do not have such math background knowledge. Having taken IS424 first will make this difficult course, Machine Learning & Applications, easier.'\n",

Students will be equipped with the ability to apply theory and understand how strategic communication has evolved to influence the integration of paid, earned, shared and owned media which are vital to unearthing unique characteristics that drive communication practice in countries in Asia. In addition to gaining insights from top Asian practitioners in the region, students will also acquire in-depth knowledge of the socio-political-cultural-economic factors that underpin the practice that influence business outcomes in the world’s most populous continent. This course will prepare students in communication management to readily transit and take on responsibilities to manage communication for businesses operating across Asia.'\n",

The desire to accumulate resources is found across civilisations. Yet, should wealth simply measured in economic and financial terms? Should poverty be only measured through the same lens? Many cultures promote the virtues of prudence and fortitude, peppered with ideals of justice and equality in its various guises. Wealth and poverty are often seen as diametric. Despite this, several traditions point to the need for thinking through forms of wealth (and poverty) beyond the conventional lens of economics, and to consider the pursuit of wealth of time, happiness, peace, relationships, and other elements that enrich the human experience. It is little wonder that in our contemporary age, several scholars have pointed towards the reprioritisation of wealth accumulation towards one that places happiness, health and other non-monetary goals as the ideal. In this course, we will be exploring substantially several forms of wealth (beyond the conventional), and to consider carefully the causes and strategies to address the challenges related to wealth and poverty in our contemporary world.\n",

In so doing, we look into the ways people, their customs, laws and culture respond to their perceptions and experiences of wealth and poverty; reflect on how they debate the purposes and outcomes of wealth and poverty; and discuss how they compete and cooperate for limited resources in our contemporary world.

The desire to accumulate resources is found across civilisations. Yet, should wealth simply measured in economic and financial terms? Should poverty be only measured through the same lens? Many cultures promote the virtues of prudence and fortitude, peppered with ideals of justice and equality in its various guises. Wealth and poverty are often seen as diametric. Despite this, several traditions point to the need for thinking through forms of wealth (and poverty) beyond the conventional lens of economics, and to consider the pursuit of wealth of time, happiness, peace, relationships, and other elements that enrich the human experience. It is little wonder that in our contemporary age, several scholars have pointed towards the reprioritisation of wealth accumulation towards one that places happiness, health and other non-monetary goals as the ideal. In this course, we will be exploring substantially several forms of wealth (beyond the conventional), and to consider carefully the causes and strategies to address the challenges related to wealth and poverty in our contemporary world. Through critical engagement with a variety of disciplines and empirical contexts, we will consider the intertwined phenomena of wealth and poverty in theory and praxis. The course explores the value systems we attach to each, why, and with what consequences for ourselves and others. We investigate how our notions of wealth and poverty contribute directly to the construction of our identity as well as ideas about inequality, power, justice, progress, and more. In so doing, we look into the ways people, their customs, laws and culture respond to their perceptions and experiences of wealth and poverty; reflect on how they debate the purposes and outcomes of wealth and poverty; and discuss how they compete and cooperate for limited resources in our contemporary world. Also, we will study how our knowledge and conception of wealth and poverty may continually change over time. By the end of the course, students will have an expansive understanding of how these two phenomena come together in ways that structure and define their everyday lives.'\n",

Second, we will critically examine what Hollywood films reveal about America’s perceptions and ideas about Asia within the context of Asia’s entangled history with the United States from the late 19th century to 1990s - from the period of American imperial expansion, America’s orientalism, US occupation of Japan, the Cold War, and America’s involvement in Vietnam. Next, we will explore the recent trajectories in Hollywood that shaped/reconfigured Asia’s filmic representation - the commodification of Asia in Hollywood, the impact of 9/11 on Hollywood’s image of Asia, and the shifting aspects of Asian identities (gender and race) in contemporary Hollywood films. Finally, we will examine the rising influence of Asia (its film industries, states, and societies) in global/Hollywood filmmaking and discuss how these disruptions and changes will impact Asia, the United States, and the rest of the world.'\n",

Against this backdrop, this course examines the prohibitions, rules and standards that govern transnational corruption laws and anti-bribery compliance law and practice. The course will start by generally examining the ethos and expectations of the key regulators / enforcers before reviewing the FCPA and UK Bribery Act. It will also consider the importance of internal controls and the components of an effective anti-bribery compliance (“ABC”) program. We then examine the use of deferred prosecution agreements, and non-prosecution agreements by regulators. We go on to analyse case studies of instances of corruption (e.g., Siemens AG, Rolls Royce, Goldman Sachs etc). In the last part of the course, we consider the need to create and implement internal controls and ABC programs that go beyond the letter of the law (e.g., codes of ethics, social responsibility standards, and the creation of institutional culture of compliance).'\n",

Availability of large amounts of data, both structured and unstructured, has further increased the need to understand and extract all the relevant information from these data. In this course, we will start from the basic idea about what is consumer and business analytics. We will delve into different types of analytics like descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics, different types of data, structured and unstructured, and different types of analysis and tools. As such, we will use developments in statistical science to examine solutions to important issues faced in consumer analytics. There will be various cases and readings provided and used in the class to demonstrate the importance of data-driven decision making. Specifically, we will discuss regression, measuring online impact, conducting field experiments, and new product and innovation related analytics. The main emphasis of this course is on understanding, interpreting and proper use of various research techniques and providing students with important quantitative acumen for appreciating consumer analytics.'\n",

This course invites students to explore the dynamic relationship between law and society. Specifically, the course will delve into the intersections of law, human behavior, public policy, economic insights, and emerging AI/technologies. We will examine how economic principles shape legal systems, how behavioral phenomena influence decision-making, how public policy impacts our society, and how AI and emerging technologies impact the (future of) law. By discussing some of the most pressing challenges society faces students will develop critical thinking skills and better appreciation of the context in which law and legal systems operate.

(ii) innovations in the design of the supply chain enable the firm to lower its cost base, leverage the innovative capabilities of its suppliers, and get its products and services to your customers faster and at lower cost. Toyota’s well-known Keiretsu model is a good example of process or supply chain innovation, that lowers the cost of delivery, and improves service levels simultaneously.

Many problems of global concern, like climate change, the use of artificial intelligence, pandemics, and great power conflicts, are characterized by the tension between self-interest and cooperation, miscommunication, and misalignment of incentives. Game theory is a powerful and incisive tool to analyse these issues because it has been used extensively to address collective-action challenges, which are at the heart of most game-theoretical applications in the social sciences; moreover, solutions to these challenges must account for information manipulation and unintended consequences, which are core game theory concepts.
